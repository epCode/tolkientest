A labor of love years in the making, this game is beloved by family and friends. I am posting to give others the same joy we've had playing it, and of course as a small tribute to one of my favorite authors of all time.

So many changes from the original LOTT. Many things have been "stolen" from other amazing mods, all credit to other (actual) coders who paved the way. Some of these additions:

-Extra items and creatures from lots of mods, put together in a more-or-less immersive way
-Extensive "documentation" with crafted books
-Tons of neat items, weapons, and armor such as Glamdring, Lothlorien clothing, Sting, Wizard Staff, Gimli Axe, Elvish Glaive, Grond, Phial of Galadriel, Elvish Bow, Elfstone, and of course the One Ring. All have different magical effects or abilities. Some dropped, some crafted.
-Complete ringcrafting overhaul. All four rings are very hard to obtain, and all four are amazing. Extensive instructions.
-Four magical rods (great for early/mid game) with various amazing abilities, which can be combined to form two Silmarils. Both are very powerful.
-With all the weaponry and items, PVE and PVP are fun and often surprising, with many tactical options both ranged and melee.
-Powerful mobs, some with debilitating effects and spells
-Much of the amazing work preserved from the original LOTT such as the races, biomes, and structures
-Racial bonuses. Hobbits are able to quietly vanish when "Big Folk" come blundering by! Elves step lightly, and dwarves are hardy.
-To figure out some basic recipes, make a Craft Book:

Papyrus (three horizontal) --> Paper
Paper (three vertical) --> Book
Surround the book with sticks
Many recipes are locked behind more advanced books, which are craftable and even included in many recipes.

The bad:

I forked LOTT years ago, so there is a ton of legacy code. Much has been patched over, so you will find bugs and not-great ways of doing things. Help is always welcome.
Not everything is lore friendly. But hey, it's not nearly as bad as the stuff done lately in Tolkien's name!
