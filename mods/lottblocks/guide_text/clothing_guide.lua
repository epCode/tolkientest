	"\\\"The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadrim wove.\\\"\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Sadly, this wondrous clothing has been lost and scattered throughout the world.  It has been observed that some dangerous monsters rarely carry it with them - perhaps as a trophy, or perhaps because they can make use of the magical properties of the cloth.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Should you find some, you are indeed fortunate.  Wearing it refreshes the mind while being a comfort to the body.  Each item increases mana regen by 20%, up to a maximum of 200%.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"According to legend, scraps may be found by evil monsters such as trolls, orcs, nazgul, dead men, and dunlending men.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"DWARVEN ARMOR\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Made by dwarvish smiths, this hardy armor is indestructable. It was forged to be impervious to even the hottest fire, and imparts that protection to the wearer.  Each piece reduces fire damage.  Should you find all three pieces (boots, helm, greaves) and wield the powerful elven ring Narya, you will be completely immune to even the hottest lava!\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Dwarvish armor is said to have been collected by the mighty witch kings deep below the surface who fight with dwarves.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"RANGER BOOTS\\\n\\\n" ..
	"These soft boots are perfect for long journeys - and look to have been through many.  Their supple leather seem to give the wearer an almost magical ability to step lightly and quickly, like a sure-footed elf.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Ranger boots are extremely rare and found on the corpses of only the most ancient and powerful of monsters.\\\n\\\n\"}"
