	"\\\"There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse.\\\"\\\n\\\n" ..
	"In Mordor, where the shadows lie, wyverns have been sighted.  They are said to be thieves, not of gold or silver, but of great dragon eggs.  These eggs are exceedingly rare!\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Below the earth, massive ogres covet shiny trinkets.  Also very rare, sometimes you will find an ancient gem, plucked from the carcass of a dead dragon.  Who knows how the ogres came by these gems?\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Both eggs and gems are of four varieties representing the four colors of dragons:  Red (fire), Green (poison), Blue (ice), and Black (lightning).\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Should you find a dragon egg and a gem of the same color, you may breed a dragon of your own!\\\n\\\n" ..
	"First, the gem must be coated with poison.  While deadly to many races, dragon eggs are nourished by it.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"The only poison in the world known to be powerful enough is from the spiders of Mirkwood, offspring of the terrible Shelob.  To harvest this poison, you must confront the spiders.  With a stout sword in one hand and an empty glass bottle in the other, make your journey to the spider-infested forest.  Once you find a spider, and before you slay it, use the bottle on the spider to harvest some of its venom.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"You must coat the dragon gem with poison, which will yield a prepared gem of the correct color.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Next, you must prepare a nest for the dragon egg, which will only grow and hatch in suitable surroundings.  Under the egg, in a 3x3 square, you must place the following materials:\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Red: Adobe\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Blue: Gneiss\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Green: Mossy wood\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Black: Basalt\\\n\\\n" ..
	"Once you have the nest prepared, place the egg in the middle.  You can then 'feed' the appropriate type of prepared gem (only one is required) to the egg.  After a time, a new dragonling will hatch!  It will be 'bound' to the one who fed it the gem.  Right clicking will allow you to mount your dragon to fly it.  Right clicking while flying will put the dragon back in your inventory.\\\n\\\n" ..
	"While you are flying your dragon, you may press the 'use' key (usually E) to have your pet dragon breathe fire, ice, poison, or lightning, depending on its color.\\\n\"}"
